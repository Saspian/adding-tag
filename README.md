## About
There is a text box, with some (static) default options in dropdown, also can be access when clicked inside input. Typed options are added seperatly above the input when ticked button is clicked. Clear button inside the input field works!

#### If you find following things not working, its because the work is still in progress
- ~~cross button inside the selected options (above the input field) doesn't work~~
- ~~Clicking default options won't do anything~~
- ~~selected options cannot be added as default options~~
